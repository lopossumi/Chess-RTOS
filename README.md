# Chess-RTOS
> Why spend 20 euros on a game clock when you can build one yourself in slightly less than infinite amount of free time?

This project is a chess clock running on Arduino Uno. It's built on top of FreeRTOS (real-time operating system) and requires a 16x2 liquid crystal display.

It is by no means a tournament-worthy timepiece, but works nonetheless.

# Why?
I wanted a game clock, and had a bunch of Arduinos lying around. It was also a good opportunity to try out embedded development with GitHub copilot.

# Features
The clock has a bunch of modes to choose from:
* Sudden Death
* Fischer
* Hourglass
* Simple Delay
* (TODO: Byo-Yomi)

# Installation
